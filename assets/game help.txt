ZenF, not to be confused with the german word "Senf" ( = mustard ),
is a Zen puzzle game to relax and pass the time.
The game is about flattening towers on a board to cover all tiles 
and bring the height of all towers to 1.

This is an exemplary game board of size 3x3 
with 4 towers of height 1, 2, 3 and 4:

This is an empty tile:

This is a tower with height 3:

In "Move and Select" mode:
Use the left/right/up/down button to move the cursor over the board.
If the cursor is over a tower tile, press A to select this tower 
and switch to "Flatten" mode.
If you press B instead you will switch to "De-Flatten" mode.
You can recognize this mode by the blinking marking around a tile.

In "Flatten" mode:
Use the left/right/up/down button to spread the selected stower one by one 
in the corresponding direction and shrink the height of the tower.
You can recognize this mode by the outward pointing blinking arrows.
Press A to leave this mode and switch back to "Move and Select" mode
or press B to quickly switch to "De-Flatten" mode.

In "De-Flatten" mode:
Use the left/right/up/down button to undo the spreaded tiles of a tower 
in the corresponding opposite direction and therefore raise the tower again.
You can recognize this mode by the inward pointing blinking arrows.
Press B to leave this mode and switch back to "Move and Select" mode
or press A to quickly switch to "Flatten" mode.

Goal of the game:
Lay out all tower tiles so that they cover the whole board and 
all towers have the height 1.
